FLL Timer
=========

This is a clone of the FIRST LEGO League Timer we can see at the Robot Games.

It uses the same colors as the original one but that's where the similarities end. This one uses a custom "7 segments" font, has an tool box to set a custom time, and is open source !

I created it some time ago so it's not very optimized. I will update it from time to time to make it look even better.

The code and texts are currently written in French. I'll try to make it more international.

Features
--------

*   2:30 Timer designed for the Robot Game challenge of the FLL
*   Designed for full screen mode
*   Timer turns red when reaching 10 seconds
*   You can set your own time
*   Keyboard shortcuts: SPACE/ESC to start/pause the timer, R to restart, P to open the custom dialog

Disclaimer
----------

This is an independent project that is not tied to the organisators of the competition by any mean.

Feel free to make propositions to make it better =)
